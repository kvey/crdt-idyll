# So what is a CRDT

CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type)s enable eventual consistency.
As multiple instances of them are either merged or their operations are
evaluated, they will always resolve to a consistent final state.
They're often used in distributed systems or for other collaborative applications.


# A Simple CRDT (2P-Set)

[var name:"userAEvents" value:`[{t: 1, o: "added", id: "üçá"},{t: 2, o: "added", id: "üçâ"},{t: 3, o: "removed", id: "üçâ"},{t: 4, o: "added", id: "ü•ë"},{t: 5, o: "added", id: "üçå"} ]` /]
[var name:"userAEventsTimestamped" value:`[]` /]
[var name:"userBEvents" value:`[{t: 1, o: "added", id: "ü•¶"},{t: 2, o: "removed", id: "üçá"},{t: 3, o: "added", id: "üçâ"}]` /]
[var name:"userBEventsTimestamped" value:`[]` /]
[var name:"timeA" value:`5` /]
[var name:"timeB" value:`5` /]


## A Grocery List
We're going to use a grocery list as an approximation of a set.
Try adding or remove items from your list.

[SetEditor events:userAEvents time:timeA /]

We're going to use some timelines to play around
when events occur. Press play to see the series of changes to your
grocery list take place. Everything will resolve to the same state you see above.

[TimeSlider value:timeA events:userAEvents timestampedEvents:userAEventsTimestamped/]

[SetRepresentation events:userAEvents time:timeA/]


## A Friend

This is going to be a friend of your's editing the same grocery
list at around the same time.

[SetEditor events:userBEvents time:timeB /]

We can scrub through each of their events taking place as well:

[TimeSlider value:timeB events:userBEvents timestampedEvents:userBEventsTimestamped/]

[SetRepresentation events:userBEvents time:timeB/]

## A Conflict

Lets take a look at what happens when don't use something like a CRDT.
If events take place in different orders, we'll get different results. Try
hitting the *shuffle* button to mix up the order our events take place in.

[CombinedSetRepresentationDumb timeA:timeA timeB:timeB eventsA:userAEvents eventsB:userBEvents /]

We get different results for different orders of operations.

## Conflict-free

In contrast, using the CRDT structure fixes this.
No matter what order all of the events occur, the final state of our list will
be the same. This is the goal of eventual consistency. Everything is
deterministic, anything can happen in any order but we get the same result.

[CombinedSetRepresentation timeA:timeA timeB:timeB eventsA:userAEvents eventsB:userBEvents /]

The red box you see is what is often called a *tombstone* set. Many CRDTs use similar models.
Things that are removed are removed forever and tracked. This allows the merger of the data structure. 
User A and User B can know that whatever they removed will be gone when their states are combined.

Because items have been removed are never coming back, it doesn't matter when
the remove action occurred, only that at some point it did occur.
